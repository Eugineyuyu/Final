            After defining the principal types of minerals we can now proceed to study rocks. Rocks are 
formed from minerals, most of the time an assemblage of several (very) different minerals. Rocks 
can be classified in three broad groups as igneous, sedimentary or metamorphic.  All theses 
rocks have the same basic minerals that were discussed in the previous lesson but will be different 
due to fundamental physical process. The differences are mainly how the rocks are formed and 
how this affects the  texture (and petrology) which follows from the origin of the rocks and 
arrangement of minerals, eg. Silica among other things.  
<br>
Igneous rocks are rocks that are derived from the cooling of molten rocks, a fluid called magma.  
When magma cools and solidifies the resulting rock is referred to as igneous. Magma or molten 
rock can be variously derived but more commonly it originates from the upper mantle or from 
friction between formations in the lithospheres at surfaces of convergent plate boundaries.
<br> 
Though the lithosphere and crust act as covers to the earth, if it is broken at certain points and 
magma being liquid may rise due to buoyancy upwards towards the surface. As the magma cools 
considerable part of it solidifies before even reaching the earth’s surface. Substantial terminology 
has been developed to describe the process and the many types of bodies that are formed in the 
process. 
<br>
Lava is magma that has reached the earth’s surface. Typically this is ejected in various forms. 
The rocks that result after the magma has cooled are called volcanic rocks.  They are also said to 
be extrusive.  If magma solidifies before reaching the earth’s surface it is said to be plutonic and 
is referred to as intrusive. Intrusive rocks can eventually become visible after erosion of soil. 
The actual nature and form of igneous rocks will depend on several properties. These include 
origin of magma, the amount of gas and water in it and how it cools. 
<br>
The silica content and presence of other minerals  play a major role in defining the viscosity of the 
magma.  Magma with least proportion of silica are called basalts.  Basalts are metal rich and 
therefore dark in color. Because of their fluidity basalts move fast and form thin sheets on the 
ground.  Basalts are also dark in color.

The three types of rocks are related by processes that form what is called the rock cycle.  Igneous 
rocks, which are derived from magmatic material that was at one stage in liquid form or heavily 
viscous, can be considered as the primary or starting point of the rock cycle.  Even then the cycle 
could start at any one of the three parts. We shall therefore begin this lesson by discussing igneous 
rocks, followed by sedimentary rocks and metamorphic rocks.
