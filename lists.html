            <dd style="background-color: aqua; border: 3px solid;">Igneous rocks as defined earlier are derived from molten material (rocks) called magma.  Since 
the magma that theses rocks are derived from have different composition and cool in many 
different ways, igneous rocks occur in many different forms. In addition igneous rocks can be in 
large solid form or can be dispersed as dust particles of different sizes. Presence of water and gas 
can also play a big part in determining how igneous rocks become. </dd>
            <h5><dt>Lion</dt></h5>
            <dd style="border: 3px solid;">Rocks that reach the surface tend to cool rapidly. This way they from fine crystals or at times no 
crystals are formed. Slow cooling magma tend to from crystals that tend to be larger with a slower 
process.  Texture is therefore an indicator of cooling process. </dd>
           <h5> <dt>Cat</dt></h5>
            <dd>As stated earlier igneous rocks that cool and solidify before reaching the surface are called plutons 
or intrusive. Since these rocks are likely to cool slowly, they will be crystalline and will  tend to 
be of mixed color or non-uniform texture.  </dd>
